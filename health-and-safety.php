            <p>
                TLG Trans Company Limited is committed to providing our workforce with a safe and healthy workplace.
                The health and safety of our employees and contractors is first and foremost in all that we do.
            </p>
            <p>
                Our approach to health and safety is simple. We believe that all occupational injuries and work-related
                illnesses are preventable. Our aim is ‘Zero Harm’. We’ve translated this into an operational objective
                of sending everyone home safe – every shift – every day. This objective applies to our employees and our
                contractors, to our suppliers, and even to our visitors.
            </p>
            <p>
                TLG Trans Company Limited also has an integrated Health, Safety, Environment and Communities (HSEC)
                Management System. This system is based on our Responsible Mining Framework and is known as the
                Responsible Mining Management System (RMMS).
            </p>
            <p>
                Additionally, all TLG Mining sites provide occupational health services to their employees either
                through on-site clinics, through utilization of local occupational medical providers or though
                contracted mobile services. Each of the mine sites maintains an industrial hygiene program to
                regularly sample and assess workplace exposure to hazardous substances such as Gold and .
            </p>
            <p>
                Our goal of Zero Harm is rooted in equipping our employees with the tools, training and behaviours
                for achieving a safe and healthy workplace. In 2014, we embarked on a journey to establish an
                Interdependent Safety Culture across TLG Trans Mining. Strong leadership skills, employee involvement,
                and a personal commitment to safety are critical to this effort.
            </p>
            <p>
                In this regard, we have been providing Visible Felt Safety Leadership training across the company. The
                traits associated with Visible Felt Safety Leadership are essential for building sustainable and
                productive relationships between management, employees, contractors, local communities, customers and
                our shareholders
            </p>
            <p>
                We have taken numerous steps to ensure needs are being addressed in the communities and regions in which
                we operate. Our operations have shared action plans and preventative measures being implemented, while
                seeking and considering input from our employees, unions, contractors, communities and industry peers to
                ensure we are delivering responsive actions consistent with broader efforts.

            <h3>Performance Improvement</h3>
            <p>
                Our focus on culture, safety and leadership has helped us to improve our safety performance. We measure our
                health and safety performing using a mix of leading and lagging indicators. The indicator used to measure
                overall performance and to benchmark against our industry peers is the Total Recordable Injury Frequency (TRIF)
                rate. We also use Lost Time Injury Frequency (LTIF) rate as a reference indicator.

            <p>
                TLG Trans Company Limited Responsible Mining Management System (RMMS) standard sets context and provides the
                foundation for our overall health and safety system and related processes. Additional health and safety standards,
                including eleven High Consequence Protocols (HCPs), have been developed and implemented across TLG Trabs Mining to
                supplement RMMS requirements and to address specific health and safety hazards. The HCPs are key in that they
                establish the mandatory safe work program requirements that are fundamental to our fatality and significant incident
                prevention efforts.

            <p>
                We work to maintain a high degree of emergency preparedness across each of our operations. As part of that process,
                we have developed crisis management plans and strategies for each of our operations, including our corporate
                headquarters, and we conduct crisis management training and practice scenarios annually. Our crisis management
                plans are supplemented by site-specific emergency response plans that are catered to the unique aspects of each
                operation. In addition, each of our operations maintain emergency response capabilities suited to their unique
                working environments.

            <p>
                Occupational Health is fundamental aspect of our overall health and safety effort. Each of our operations
                maintains an industrial hygiene program tasked with identifying and monitoring potential exposures to chemical,
                biological, physical and ergonomic agents in the workplace. When potential exposures are identified, we work to
                apply the hierarchy of controls to reduce the risk to human health.
